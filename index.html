    <h1>hello :)</h1><br>
    <p>Hi! My name is bellatrix, but also sometimes rose, or sonya (and sometimes I spell it roze)</p><br>
    <p>I live in the UK, and rarely do things on the internet, but sometimes I suddenly feel like I want to make more things, and so this website is here for that. If I do make things, you'll see them here.</p><br>
    <p>My interests are mainly computer science, physics (especially material science, particle physics and space), music, infastructure planning (for some reason), politics, and a very specific intersection between media, culture, and the internet that I can't quite express in words.</p><br>
    <p>Currently, I intend to essay a bit more on gender, politics and whatever else I randomly decide is interesting, and <i>maybe</i> code some interesting things.</p>
