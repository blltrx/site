    <h1>Where has UKIP gone? (spoilers, the Conservatives)</h1>
    <p>

        The UKIP is the only political party that will never abolish the pound for the euro and will never abandon British common law, the right to trial by jury or the presumption of innocence. Indeed we are the only party left that genuinely believes in freedom - freedom for the individual, freedom for businesses and local communities, freedom from patronising ‘political-correctness’ and from intolerance or injustice. We seek an independent, outward-looking Britain, not the offshore province of a centralised ‘Europe’, whose people are told what to do and what to think. ... The UKIP is a moderate, mainstream party which believes in the British people."
        <br>Those are the words of UKIP in the introduction to their 2001 manifesto, eight years into its party's founding. UKIP has always been a far-right populist party, aimed at independence from the European Union, being anti-immigration, and anti-'political-correctness', ~~that~~ *and* used to be a major player in UK politics, but in the last General Election received just 0.07% of the total vote. So where has UKIP's support gone?
        <br>
        <br>UKIP was founded by Alan Sked in 1991 with the original intent of forcing the ruling Conservative party to push for the UK leaving the European Union. The party was first called the Anti-Federalist League, but was renamed to the UK Independence Party in 1993, deliberately avoiding the word 'British' to not be confused with the British National Party, a party known for its fascist policies, and connections to the White Nationalist Party and the EDL.
        <br>
        <br>The party for a long time gained no significant support across the electorate, besides a small number of single-issue voters and far-right adjacent voters, but in 2013, under the second term of Farage as leader of the party, UKIP's initial goal seemed in sight, after winning a significant number of seats in the Local Elections, and again the next year in the European Parliament Elections. With a Conservative coalition government fearing losing voters to UKIP in the next General Election, PM Cameron started to push immigration and a potential Brexit up the agenda.
        <br>
        <br>As the 2015 General Election began, the Conservatives promised a referendum of 'should the UK should leave the European Union?' to try and win over the Brexiteer vote, the precise goal of UKIPs original manifesto, almost 25 years later. That year, UKIP won the largest number of votes it would ever win in a General Election, 12.60% of the the vote share, winning one seat in the House of Commons, but more importantly, the next year, the Brexit Referendum would take place.
        <br>
        <br>While UKIP were unable to campaign as the official pro-Brexit group (that being Vote Leave) they campaigned regardless under the <a href="http://leave.eu">leave.eu</a> banner, in the end winning the referendum, but opposing the Conservatives for not being able to deliver a hard enough Brexit.
        <br>
        <br>In the next Election, UKIP would only receive 1.8% of the vote, marking the downturn of the Party, and in the 2019 Election, receiving even less, just 0.07% of the vote.
        <br>
        <br>So where did UKIP's base go? The party's principal goal has always been leaving the EU, and has long been a single issue party with a small passionate base (around 700'000 consistent voters before 2019), and despite it claiming to be "moderate" and "mainstream" in 2001, it has always been a strongly right-wing party, with its members and leaders more closely aligned to the white nationalist policies of the BNP that it would like to admit. As for it being mainstream, in 2001 most certainly not. UKIP was only a mainstream party between 2013 and 2015, in large part because of anti-immigration rhetoric pushed by most sides of the right, and parts of the left. After Brexit, it was no longer a mainstream party.
        <br>
        <br>But why? it's not like there is any less anti-immigration rhetoric from any party than there was in 2015. The difference is in where. Before May as Conservative leader, most of the explicit anti-immigration rhetoric (and often racism) were just mutterings across the Tory back bench, and from smaller right wing parties, so UKIP garnered up support from voters who were concerned about immigration in 2015. But with those back benchers taking charge in the Leave Campaign, the Conservative back bench was far more explicit in these polices, in particular the European Research Group; a Eurosceptic back bench group, immigration was now a Conservative issue. You can see this in the 2017 GE Polling, that shows 60% of voters who voted UKIP in 2015 voted Tory in 2017, only 18% continuing to vote UKIP in 2017.
        <br>
        <br>And now in 2021, most of those back benchers are now in Government, pushing the Conservative party further right still, and making those mutterings official party policy.
        <br>
        <br><img src="/assets/w11b" alt="Graph showing UKIP votes peaking in 2015, then falling">
        <br>
        <br>In the 2019 Election however, UKIP lost even its most supportive base, to Farage's new party, the Brexit Part (Now Reform UK). You can see how UKIP's base has always been small, and been taken up by largely single issue voters, as when UKIP could no longer focus on Brexit, its initial goal, it lost support to a new single issue Brexit party.
        <br>
        <br>UKIP might entirely die out as a party in the coming years, but that certainly does not mean its far-right support will. UKIP's decline shows us how previously radical, far-right and nationalist politics have entered the mainstream, first though UKIP, but now through the Conservative party, and it will be a long time before it disappears.
        <br>
        <br>"The UKIP is the only political party that will never abolish the pound for the euro and will never abandon British common law, the right to trial by jury or the presumption of innocence. Indeed we are the only party left that genuinely believes in freedom - freedom for the individual, freedom for businesses and local communities, freedom from patronising ‘political-correctness’ and from intolerance or injustice.
